							<h2>Research Experience & Interests</h2>
							<p>Since I was a child, I have always wanted to be an astronaut, so science was always something I gravitated towards. However, in 2009, my physics teacher showed the class a video demonstrating quantum locking, a phenomenon depicted on the left. This persists as the most fascinating demonstration in modern physics and sparked my initial interest in Quantum Mechanics. In my pursuit of understanding superconductors, I have developed a deep appreciation for condensed matter systems, quantum field theory, and quantum information science.</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am a half first generation Swiss national...meaning my father was born in Switzerland and my mother was born in Mississipi. From them, I recieved a southern accent, a love for good chocolate (and cornbread), and a valuable lesson that things are different in other places. I am married to my beautiful wife and have a loud, well-meaning dachshund who honestly has not hunted a single dachs (German for badger), so I am wondering now that maybe we are victims of false advertisement. Because my work forces me to sit down, read, write, and talk in large unhealthy quantities, in my free time, I like to live a pretty active lifestyle to get out of my head. I love to snowboard, climb, camp, scuba dive, run, and lift weights as much as possible. I am also an Arduino/ Raspberry Pi hobbyist who plays chess very poorly!</p>

							<h2>Outreach</h2>
							<p>The greatest teachers that I have ever had in my life had the uncanny ability to fascinate their students regardless of the subject. Unfortunately, the opposite situation is more common, and many students, young and old, miss out on an otherwise incredible opportunity which may spark a lifelong passion. For this reason, I emphasize the importance and need for great education for children and strive to generate interest in science and math through STEM outreach. Until COVID, I had continuously volunteered in some way to provide resources to the people around me. This includes volunteering at a local science museum and tutoring children K-12 in math and physics. This Fall I am planning on volunteering as a <a href ="http://wpafbstem.com/pages/wow_classroom.html"> Wizard of Wright</a> (WOW), a group which brings flashy and engaging science demonstrations to classrooms in the Dayton, OH area.</p>
